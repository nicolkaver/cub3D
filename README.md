# cub3D

This small 42 school project is a 3D game that imitates the famous Wolfstein 3D computer game: https://www.retrogames.cz/play_408-DOS.php?language=EN.

The game uses raycasting in order to create a 3D representation based on a 2D map. We used this online turorial in order to learn and understand how raycasting works: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html.

Like in the previous so_long project (2D game), we had to use the 42 school graphical library for our project. You can download and install it here: https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.

I realized this project in collaboration with *jcourtoi* : https://github.com/Keeghaan.
